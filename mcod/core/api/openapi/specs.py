    ## Legal basis

    The [DANE.GOV.PL API](https://api.dane.gov.pl) pursues the objective of the Central Public Data Repository,
    as described in the Act on Access to Public Information (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] no. 112,
    item. 1198 as amended) as one of the modes of accessing and reusing public information.

    The following regulations were issued on the basis of the Act:

    * [Regulation of the Council of Ministers regarding
    the Central Public Information Repository](http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2014/361/1)
    * [Regulation of the Minister of Digitalization of August 23,
    2018 regarding the information resource intended to be made

    ## About the API
    #### Response Content-Type

    All API responses are in [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) format.

    #### Versioning

    You can switch between API versions using the `X-API-VERSION` header in the request.
    If the `X-API-VERSION' header is not set, the latest released API version is used.

    Example:

            X-API-VERSION: 1.3

    It is also possible to change the API version by providing the API version in the path
    `https://dane.gov.pl/<api_ver>/<rest of the path>`.

    If the API version is not in the path, the answer in the latest version of the API will be returned


    Example - API 1.0:

            https://dane.gov.pl/1.0/datasets

    Example - API 1.4:

            https://dane.gov.pl/1.4/datasets

    Example - without a specify of API version:

            https://dane.gov.pl/datasets

    Attention! The api version indicated in the path has priority over the version indicated in the header


    ##### Available API versions:

    * 1.0 (release date: 14.09.2018)
    * 1.4 (release date: 17.01.2019)

    #### Translations

    By default, all API messages are translated into Polish. You can change this by setting
    the `Accept-Language` header, for example

            Accept-Language: en

    Note, than currently two languages are supported:

    * en
    * pl (default, as fallback)

    #### Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success
    or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in
    the following format:

           {
              "errors": {
                "title": {
                  "xyz": [
                    "Unknown field."
                  ]
                }
              },
              "description": "Field value error",
              "code": "entity_error",
              "title": "422 Unprocessable Entity"
            }

    #### Basic data structures

    The API provides endpoints for the following data structures:

    * **resource** - contains information and "metadata" about the data published
    by the provider,
    * **dataset** - a package of resources which is owned by the institution
    publishing the data,
    * **institution** - the organisation, institution or company that publishes the data.
